Introduction
============

TabNet is an attentive, interpretable deep learning architecture for tabular data, implemented in PyTorch. This project is a maintained fork of the original DreamQuark TabNet, with improvements for metrics, GPU support, and usability. It is suitable for classification, regression, and multitask learning on tabular datasets.

Key Features
------------
- Supports classification, regression, multitask, and unsupervised pretraining
- GPU acceleration and efficient data handling
- Interpretable feature masks and explanations
- Flexible API for research and production
